# Walmart Retail Insights: My MySQL Analysis and Presentation

## What This Project Is About

In this project, I really focused on digging into Walmart's retail data using advanced SQL queries. My goal was to find key insights that could help them make better business decisions, like understanding sales trends and customer behavior. I also created a presentation to clearly communicate my findings.

## Why I Built This (Problem Solved)

Retail companies like Walmart have vast amounts of transaction data, but without proper analysis, it's just raw numbers. I built this to:

* Transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence.
* Help identify opportunities for growth, optimize inventory, and improve customer targeting.
* Showcase how powerful SQL can be for in-depth retail analysis.
* Present complex findings in a clear and concise manner for stakeholders.

## What I Did (Key Features)

* **Advanced SQL Querying:** I used complex SQL queries to analyze sales data from various angles.
* **Sales Growth Analysis:** I analyzed sales trends over time, identified periods of growth or decline, and tracked performance by different categories.
* **Customer Segmentation:** I segmented customers based on their purchasing behavior, helping to identify high-value customers, frequent shoppers, or specific buying patterns.
* **Product Performance Analysis:** I identified top-selling products, slow-moving items, and profitable product lines.
* **Branch Performance:** I pinpointed top-performing branches and locations based on sales metrics, which is crucial for operational planning.
* **Data-Driven Recommendations:** My analysis led to insights that could help optimize inventory, improve marketing strategies, and enhance overall store performance.
* **Presentation Creation:** I summarized my key findings and recommendations in a clear and engaging presentation format.

## Tools I Used

* **MySQL** (My primary tool for database querying and analysis)
* **SQL Workbench / other SQL client** (For executing queries and viewing results)
* **Microsoft PowerPoint** (For creating the presentation of insights)

## How You Can See My Work

This project includes both the SQL queries used for analysis and a presentation summarizing the key insights.

1.  **Get My Project Files:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nayan9572/walmart-retail-insights.git](https://github.com/nayan9572/walmart-retail-insights.git)
    cd walmart-retail-insights
    ```

2.  **View the SQL Queries:**
    * You'll need a MySQL server running (e.g., via XAMPP, Docker, or a cloud service) and a MySQL client like MySQL Workbench.
    * If applicable, import the dataset into your MySQL server.
    * Open the `MySQL_Queries.sql` file in your MySQL client and execute the queries to see the raw results.

3.  **View the Presentation:**
    * Open the `Project_PPT.pptx` file with Microsoft PowerPoint or any compatible presentation software.
    * The presentation contains a summary of the analysis, key findings, and actionable business implications.

## My Results and What I Learned

* I successfully identified top-performing products and customer segments, providing clear insights into revenue drivers for Walmart.
* My analysis helped to optimize business decisions by highlighting key areas for improvement in sales and customer engagement.
* This project significantly enhanced my skills in advanced SQL querying, data manipulation, extracting meaningful business intelligence from large relational datasets, and effectively communicating complex data insights through a professional presentation.
